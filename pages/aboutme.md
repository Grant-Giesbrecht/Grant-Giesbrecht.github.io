**So What's my Background?** My undergraduate degree is in physics from Centre College in Kentucky. While at Centre, I had to oportunity to conduct research both at my home institution, and at a couple outside labs. I got my start in research doing robophysics research with Dr. Bruce Rodenborn at Centre. Our robophysics experiments were aimed at better understanding animal locomotion through creating robotic models. I later interned at NASA's Johnson Space Center (<i>think: "Houston, we have a problem here".</i>) working on mission safety by modeling laucnh abort schenarios for commercial crew vehicles and identifying failure modes.

I then entered the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program through the US Department of Energy, through which I first completed an internship at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab (PPPL). At PPPL, I helped to develop a low noise amplifier that would operate in a cryogenic environment for a beam emission spectroscopy (BES) system. This instrument was modeled off the BES installed on NSTX-U, the tokamak at PPPL, and is intened for use on W7-X, the stellarator in Griefswald, Germany.

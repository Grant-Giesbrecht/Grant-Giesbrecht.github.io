When I was in high school, I remember reading about CPUs on Wikipedia and seeing a homemade 8-bit CPU on a breadboard and thinking it was extremely cool. Computers and CPUs were a black box to me that I imagined to be so complicated that no one person would understand the entire system. Afterall, modern computers are so fast and so capable, to understand the underlying circuit on that level seemed impossible. A few years later, I saw a [step-by-step tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Build-an-8-Bit-Computer/) detailing how to build a simple CPU from logic gates and it was deeply satisfying to understand how a primitive CPU could be made. I decided I had to make one myself, and I set off to build my own CPU.

### Project Overview

Although the project has evolved considerably over the years, the core goals have remained largely unchanged.
<ul>
    <li>Build a functional computer around a homemade 8-bit CPU. </li>
    <li>Enough computational power to serve as a basic calculator. </li>
    <li>Build the CPU primarily from 7400 series logic gates. Expections to this rule include anything that would bottleneck the CPU if made only from logic gates, and isn't inherently CPU-related. Primarily this includes:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Memory:</b>To make the computer interesting, I need plenty of memory. Building my own RAM or some form of non-volitile memory from scratch isn't the point of this project. I use lots of COTS RAM, flash, and EEPROM.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Give the computer flash memory and a USB programming interface to support long and sophisticated programs.</li>

During the start of my PhD, I worked on research in developing high-bandwidth high-efficiency
microwave power amplifiers (PAs). These amplifiers have applications spanning next-generation
communications systems, radar transmitters, to fusion technologies. When efficiency is a key
factor in the design of a PA, a technique called load modulation is often used. Load modulation
changes the load impedance presented to the PA's transistor and allows you to keep the transistor 
operating in it's most efficient regime across a range of output powers (something that is not otherwise possible).
Load modulation itself is not a new idea, and has been in widespread use since William Doherty published his
eponymous architecture in 1936. What does require innovation, is coupling broadband design with
the efficiency enhancements provided by load modulation. 

The purpose of the figure of merit project was to develop a singular figure from which various transistors
could be evaluated in their ability to be used successfully in a load modulated power amplifier design.
When selecting a transistor for a PA design, it is challenging to be sure which transistor will provide
the best performance without going through the process of designing a PA around each transistor candidate,
and comparing the simulated results. Needless to say, this isn't a desirable workflow.

My figure of merit captures numerous parameters such as target impedance and maximum power added efficiency in
one metric.

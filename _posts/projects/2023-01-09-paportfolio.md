While I'm hard at work getting this page ready, why not check out some of my other [projects](https://grantgiesbrecht.com/projects/)? If you're looking for suggestions, my [homemade CPU](https://grantgiesbrecht.com/projects/blinkenrechner/), [linear accelerator](https://grantgiesbrecht.com/projects/meqalac/), and [transistor figure of merit](https://grantgiesbrecht.com/projects/fom/) projects are three of my favorites.

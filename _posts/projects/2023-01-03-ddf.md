You'd think that once you've collected and analyzed data, saving and re-reading it would be the easy part. For many types of data such as images, documents, or executables, it <i>is</i> the easy part. So why is it so complicated for general data, such as a list of numbers?

You're probably thinking this is a solved problem. "There are plenty of formats! CSV, NPY, PKL, HD5, need I go on?". These formats all have their merits. Some are very effient at serializing the data, importing data to and from a specific programming language, or being universally readable. However, when a project or data changes hands, be it to a collaborator or a new generation of researchers, having the data be <i>self evident</i> is critical. Although there are ways to work around this with established formats, such as adding headers in CSVs, this is not standardized and required a customized import system for each format, which is cumbersome and time consuming. This is where DDF comes in.

### Overview of Format

The purpose of DDF file format is to provide a way to save data that is:
1. <b>Human Readable:</b> Saves data in plain text, so you can read or create this file type with just a text editor, should the need arise. This also makes creating functions for reading and writing DDF files for your programming language of choice much easier than if it were a binary standard. It uses a syntax that is designed to prioritize human-readability over file size.
2. <b>Self-Evident:</b> The data saved in DDF are not just associated with a variable name, but comments can be provided for each variable so that the data can be understood on their own. The format also encourages users to provide a description for the whole file through the use of a header paragraph.

A syntax example is shown below. In this brief example, the syntax for adding a header and variables is shown. DDF supports three types of variables, doubles, booleans, and strings, in addition to 1D and 2D matrices of all these types. To declare a variable, the type is indicated by the first token `d`, `b` or `s` for double, boolean and string, respectively. To declare a matrix, place the matrix type in angle brackets, preceeded by an m. For example, a matrix of doubles would be declared with `m<d>`.

    </div><!-- /.medium-4.columns -->

</div><!-- /.row -->

Additionally, you can decalre variables using a vertical syntax. This allows lists to be easily added to without needing to read in the file and rewrite it for each addition. The target application of this is long-term data logging with computationally-limited embedded system. An example is shown below.

<div class="row">
    <div class="medium-12 columns t30">
    <img src="{{ site.urlimg }}ddf_syntax_ex2.png" alt="">
    </div><!-- /.medium-4.columns -->

</div><!-- /.row -->

I've written input/output classes for DDF in three popular languages: C++, Python, and MATLAB. You can get started on the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Grant-Giesbrecht/DDF).
